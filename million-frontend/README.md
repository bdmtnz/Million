    git clone https://github.com/bdmtnz/Million.git
    cd Million/million-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create if not exist a `.env` file in the root of the project.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To run the application in **development mode**, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

This will start the development server. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates the static files in the `dist` directory.
